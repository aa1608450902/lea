# lea

A utility programming language.

'lea' means 'learn'! I just want to write light-weight programming language to help me complete some simple tasks!

I hope i can insist on accomplishing the project!

At present, this isn't a completed project. So, it's unnecessary to download the project!

## build

**08.06.2021 update** Now, you can just build parsing program of 'lea' language! And this will go on for a long time. 

If the compiler/interpreter program is finished, I will update the abstract of the README.

**08.10.2021 update** Now, you can compile the simple "lea" program - main.lea, using the following command.

```shell
make          # build parsing program - lea
make assemble # generate assemble file of main.lea
make compile  # compile and link to generate executable file - main.lea.run
make run      # run the executable file - main.lea.run
make clean    # remove cache files in build directory
```
